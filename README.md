# Sentiment Analysis API

An API to provide sentiment analysis rating on text data.
Sentiment Analysis powered by Vader.

A RESTful API built with Python 3.8.10 and Flask-Restful running in a virtual environment hosted on Heroku.

Currently a work in progress ...

TODO:

- Redesign API to be interface for Parley rather than purely for Sentiment Analysis
- Database CRUD operations
- User Request Authentication
